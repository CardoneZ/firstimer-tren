Hello! I'm a software engineering student who is passionate about technology and the world of programming. I enjoy learning new programming languages and technical challenges, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy playing League of Legends competitively. I love the teamwork and strategy required to win in this game. I constantly strive to improve my gaming skills, learn new tactics, and stay up-to-date with the latest updates and changes in the game.

In addition to my love of technology and video games, I'm also a dedicated gymrat. I love staying fit and always try to include a workout session in my daily routine. I enjoy challenging myself and reaching my fitness goals, and I believe this also translates to my work and gaming, as I always aim to push myself and achieve more.
